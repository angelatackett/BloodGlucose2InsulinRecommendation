# Insulin Recommendation Program

*** INSULIN INFORMATION GENERATOR ***
This program prompts the user for the number of times
they have tested their blood glucose levels. It prompts
for the individual measurements and provides the number
of units of insulin that each measurement requires. The 
program wraps up by providing the total amount of blood
glucose the user has measured for today, the total
recommended units of insulin, and the average amount
of insulin recommended for use throughout the day.
